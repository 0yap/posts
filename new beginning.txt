so i redid the website again. i realized that i was just trying to improve the style a bit too much and didnt really write anything. so heres a new version of the website, simple, unstyled, minimal and fast. now i can finally (hopefully) focus on the thing that matters the most.. writing. expect more frequent posts from now on as i can just forget how the site works and only write. there will be an archive of all of the old posts soon, dont worry, i didnt delete them. thanks for reading this little introductory post and remember, if you want to chat or just say hi, you can email me at hi@0yap.com.
